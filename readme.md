# Default Gateway Microservice

The Default Gateway microservice is a critical component of the Microservices Music Metadata Enrichment System, responsible for managing all incoming requests and directing them to the appropriate microservices. It serves as the API gateway, providing a unified entry point for clients to access various microservices within the system.

## Overview

The Default Gateway microservice plays a vital role in the overall architecture, acting as a central entry point for clients and ensuring that requests are properly routed to the corresponding microservices. It abstracts the complexities of the underlying microservices and provides a unified interface for users to interact with the system.

## Functionality

- **Request Routing**: The Default Gateway receives incoming HTTP requests from clients and routes them to the appropriate microservices based on the endpoint paths.

- **Authentication and Authorization**: It handles user authentication and authorization by validating JWT tokens provided by clients before forwarding requests to the respective microservices.

- **Load Balancing**: The Default Gateway implements load balancing mechanisms to distribute incoming requests evenly across multiple instances of microservices for better performance and scalability.


## Dependencies

- **Spring Boot**: The microservice is built using the Spring Boot framework, enabling rapid development and deployment.

- **Spring Cloud Gateway**: Used to implement the API gateway functionality and request routing.

- **Authentication and Authorization (Auth API)**: The Default Gateway relies on the Auth API to handle user authentication and authorization.

- **Load Balancer **: Depending on the deployment strategy, a load balancer may be used to distribute requests across multiple instances of the microservices.

## How to Use

Developers and clients interact with the Default Gateway microservice directly by making HTTP requests. It forwards requests to the appropriate microservices based on the endpoint paths.
